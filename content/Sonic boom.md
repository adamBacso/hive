happens when a source travels faster than the [[speed of sound]]

>[!important] continuous phenomenon
>can be heard when the receiver intersects the “cone” of sound

# cone angle
$$\sin(\alpha)=\frac{v_{\text{sound}}}{v_{\text{object}}}$$
$\frac{v_{\text{sound}}}{v_{\text{object}}}$ is the inverse of the [[Mach number]] → faster the plane, the more pointed to cone

# pressure
![[N-wave]]

![[boom carpet]]

# sound
[[loudness|amplitude]] is dependent on the amount of air moved:
larger aircraft → louder sound

# concerns
sonic boom causes public concerns (effects on hearing and general distribution of peace) as well as possible damage to structures

supersonic flight is prohibited above land → makes supersonic transport (SST) unviable
