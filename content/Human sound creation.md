summary: 
status: draft 
---
1. during [[phonation]], [[vocal folds|vocal cords]] become closed by *arytenoid cartilages*
2. vocal cords are forced apart by positive air pressure
3. low air pressure closes them yet again ([[Bernoulli effect]])

the frequency of the bursts of air determine the frequency of the [[sound]] 
>[!important] Only odd harmonics are produced by the vocal folds
>[[vocal tract]] is a [[closed tube resonator]]
>
>**frequency is further affected by [[articulators]]**

**frequency** can by influenced by:
- length and weight of vocal folds 

**amplitude** can be influenced by:
- increase of airflow
- increase of resistance in vocal folds
>[!info] wider and longer opening → higher amplitude, lower frequency

>myoelastic aerodynamic theory of phonation
