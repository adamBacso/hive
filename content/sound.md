Sound is a [[Longitudinal waves|longitudinal wave]] spreading in a flexible medium that is perceivable by the [[ears|ear]].

>Pitch is determined by frequency 

ear -([[reflection]])→ ear canal → [[eardrum]] → [[ossicles]] (amplification and limiting force) → oval window → [[cochlea]] (different parts resonate at different frequency)

frequency: pitch 
amplitude: loudness
overtones: timbre

[[infrasound]]: <20 Hz
[[ultrasound]]: >20 000 Hz
