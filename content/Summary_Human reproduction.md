# What are the tasks of the clitoris? (3p)
sexual arousal and orgasm (richest in mechanoreceptors)

# List the tasks of the [[vagina]]? What is the task of its acidic pH? (4p)
- organ of intercourse
- channel of menstrual flow
- childbirth canal
acidic pH → protects against **infection**

# Name the parts of the [[uterus]]! Write about the menstrual cycle and the task of the uterus! (5p)
![[corpus of uterus]]![[cervix]] 

TASK: where *fetus* develops

endometrium gets *thinner* without fertilization, endometrium *sheds* with the help of blood

# What are the tasks of the ovaries? (4p)
gonad → produces egg cells
produces sex hormones ([[estrogen]], progesterone)

# Explain the erection of the penis! (Structures, happenings) (5p)
1. directed from [[brain]] and [[spinal cord]] (under *inhibition*)
2. *arteries* relax → blood enters *sinuses*
3. veins *closed* by filled corpus cavarnousa

# List the organs that produce some parts of the semen! (3p)
[[testicles]], [[seminal vesicles]], [[prostate gland]]

# What are the tasks of the testicles? (3p)
produces sperm cells
produces androgen as endocrine gland

# Why is prostate gland important? (4p)
place where semen components unite, muscular muscle contracts contracts → orgasm

# Where does the fertilization happen? How long does human pregnancy last?  Where does the implantation of the embryo happen? (3p)
[[fallopian tubes]], 38-40 weeks (9 months), [[implantation]] in the [[uterus]] 

# Write a few things about the 1st trimester? (4p)
- fertilization
- implantation
- **highest risk of misscarriage**
- heartbeat

# What happens in the 2nd trimester? (5p)
- baby bump
- movement can be felt
- sex can be determined (by [[ultrasound]] )
- fetus can react to sounds
- high chance of survival outside of [[uterus]] 

# List the steps of childbirth in order! (5p)
![[Pregnancy#Childbirth]]

# What can spread STD pathogens? (3p)
blood, vaginal discharge, semen (enter through microtears)

# Write about syphilis! (5p)
- **painless** ulcers around genitals
- warts around the body (*antibiotics still effective*)
- lurks
- bacteria spreads to nervous system, bones, vascular system
- death

# Why is chlamydia dangerous? (4p)
**80%** of females without symptoms, **50%** of males
infectious
causes infertility

# Write about human papillomavirus? (4p)
- vaccines against it (different variants)
- cancer in genitals
- papilloma around genitals and other skin surface
- **infectious**

# What are the advantages of condom usage? (3p)
- mechanical protection
- easy to get
- almost 100% security (*physically stops sperm*)

# Write about spermicides! (4p)
- used in vagina (15 minutes before sex)
- easy to get
- stops sperm movement → cannot reach the egg
- forms
	- gel
	- foam
	- suppositories

# Choose 2 fertility awareness methods and explain 1 of them! (5p)
## Coitus interruptus
>vaginal intercourse stopped before ejaculation
## Temperature method
>temperature taken every morning (same conditions)

~0.2°C increase is a sign of ovulation → avoid sex for **6 days**
## Cervical mucus method
>mucus becomes like *egg-white* and *rubbery*
## Ogino-Knauss / calendar method
>menstrual cycle tracked for 6 months

ovulation in the **middle** of the cycle

# Compare the birth control pill and birth control ring (common and different features)! (5p)
contain estrogen/progesterone → prevent ovulation (*fake pregnancy*)
used for **21 days**, [[menstruation]] happens in the remaining **7**

| birth control pill   | birth control ring                           |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| taken orally         | inserted in the vagina                       |
| absorbed through gut | absorbed through vaginal mucus (more direct) | 

# How can the IUD/IUS prevent pregnancy? (5p)
makes endometrium thinner
IUD - **copper** causes *sterile infection*
IUS - hormones prevent ovulation

# Write about the morning after pill! (4p)
used within 3-5 days of sex
contains large amounts of progesterone 
>[!warning] may change menstrual cycle

# What is made in the case of female sterilization? (4p)
**laparoscopic operation**
[[fallopian tubes]] are sealed

# What is vasectomy? (4p)
short surgery (*15-30 minutes*)
vas deferens are sealed
