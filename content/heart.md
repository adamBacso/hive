- center of cardiovascular system
- blood vessels → coronary arteries
- impulse generation and leading system → heartbeat

# 4 chambres
- right atrium
- right ventricle
- left atrium
- right ventricle

[[heart valves]] prevent the backflow of blood

# systemic circulation
left ventricle → arteries → body capillaries → veins → right atrium

veins transport **deoxygenated** blood

# pulmonary circulation
right ventricle → pulmonary arteries → lung capillaries → pulmonary veins → left atrium

pulmonary veins transport **oxygenated** blood

# cardiac cycle
1. left and right atria contract
2. left and right ventricles contract (atria relax)
3. both of them relax

# heartrate
average 72/min

# stroke volume
>volume of blood pumped out from heart in 1 beat

on average: 0.8 dl
