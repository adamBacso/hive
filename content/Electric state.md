There are two electric states:
- positive: *eg.* glass rubbed by silk
- negative: *eg.* plastic rubbed by fur

>[!important] Electric state behavior
>Objects with like charge repel
>Objects with opposite charge attract

**RUBBED OBJECTS GET INTO OPPOSITE ELECTRIC STATES**

*[[conductors]]* and *[[insulators]]*

>Electric is caused by excess / lack of electrons 

All charges are the multiples of the charge of an electron, called [[elementary charge]]
