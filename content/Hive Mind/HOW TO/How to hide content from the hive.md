Add the path of your private folder(s) to the `.gitignore` right after creation. If you follow the [[HOW TO/How to use Obsidian|vault creation process]], the path should look like this:
	`content/Hive Mind/notes/<REPLACE WITH YOUR FOLDER NAME>`
__If added _after_ pushing, the file(s) will already be on GitHub.__

>[!warning]
>Do not delete any paths inside the `.gitignore` file. Others have added those to prevent the display of those.
>_Please respect others' privacy_
