# Why should you use obsidian?
Obsidian is a dedicated editor for markdown files (format in which the hive was is written). It is the inteded way for the use of the hive. You may costumize to your heart's content and add whatever content you want. In the case that you wish to hide certain folders from other collaborators, just add it to the `.gitignore` in the `hive` folder (main folder of the repository).
