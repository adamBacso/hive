>[!important] Electric current (current)
>the charge passing through a cross-section of a conductor in a unit of time
>$I=\frac{Q}{t}$
>$[I]=A=\frac{C}{s}$
>*amper is SI base unit*


>The (macroscopical) ordered motion of [[charge carriers]] in a conductor.

![[charge carriers]]

To move carriers, an [[electric field]] must be maintained
