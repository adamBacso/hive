# Why do neurons differ from other cells?(3p)
Special membrane with [[sodium-potassium pump|ion channels]] → negative charge inside, positive outside
*excitable because of that*

# What is the charge of the resting potential and the action potential? Which happens when the neuron gets a stimulus? (3p)
resting potential: -70mV
[[action potential]] : +30mV 

action potential is reached when the cell is stimulated

# Name the 3 types of [[neurons]] with their tasks! (6p)
- sensory neurons 
- interneurons
- motor neurons 

# Name the 2 parts of the nervous system with their parts! (6p)
[[central nervous system]] - [[brain]] , [[spinal cord]]

[[peripheral nervous system]] - ganglia, nerves

# Name the parts of the brain diagram! (cerebrum, cerebellum, brainstem, diencephalon) (4p)

# Where can you find the medulla! Name 3 functions of the medulla! (4p)
in the brainstem 
***regulation*** of
- blood pressure
- breathing 

***reflexes***
- sneezing 
- coughing
- swallowing
- vomiting

# Where belongs the hypothalamus! Name 3 functions of the hypothalamus! (4p)
diencephalon 
- thermal regulation 
- daily physiological cycles
- endocrine system 
- controlling appetite

#  What are the tasks of the cerebellum? (4p)
- posture control 
- movement coordination
- balancing and learned movements
- precise movement 

#  Compare the somatic and the autonomic nervous system! (5p)
| somatic                | autonomic                  |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------- |
| voluntary movement     | involuntary body functions |
| *external environment* | *internal environment*                           |

# Name the 2 ways of regulation in the autonomic nervous system! Compare them in 2 points! (6p)
| sympathetic                                               | parasympathetic                                                     |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| fight or flight system - uses a lot of energy             | reserves resources                                                  |
| increased heart and breathing rate, blood goes to muscles | slower heart rate, slower breathing, blood goes to digestive system |

# Fill the gaps of the chart about the sense organs! (6p)

|               | [[eyes]]           | [[ears]]        | [[nose]]      | [[tongue]] |
| ------------- | ------------------ | --------------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| [[stimulus]]  | photon             | sound           | smell         | taste      |
| [[receptors]] | [[photoreceptors]] | mechanoreceptor | chemoreceptor | chemoreceptor            |

# What is the task of the lens and the pupil? (4p)
*lens* - focuses light by changing its shape
*pupil* - controls the amount of light entering the eye

# Name the 2 receptor types of the retina with their task! (5p)
*rods* - sense light 
*cones* - sense colors

# Where can be found the receptors of hearing? What can they sense?
[[cochlea]] 
*movement of the fluid*

# Which part of the ear intensifies the vibration? What is the frequency range we can sense? (4p)
middle ear - 3 bones connecting the eardrum and cochlea

*20-20 000 Hz*

# What can we sense with our nose and tongue?  (3p)
**water soluble** chemicals which dissolve in the mucus of the nose and saliva

# List the receptor types of the skin with 1 stimulus they can sense! (6p)
**mechanoreceptors** - touch, pressure, vibration 
**thermoreceptors** - difference in cold and warm
**pain receptors** - (free nerve endings on the top of the [[dermis]] )
