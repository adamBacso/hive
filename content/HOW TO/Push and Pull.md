# When and why to push or pull?
Pulling is recommended whenever you want to view the hive using [[How to use Obsidian|Obsidian]]. This will make sure that you are using the most up-to date version. _keyboard shortcut:_ `ctrl + shift + p`

If you made any changes to the `notes` folder, you should push those changes to GitHub so that everyone could see those pages. _keyboard shortcut:_ `ctrl + p`

>Before pushing any changes, you need to commit those changes. To my understanding this just means that you close the changes that you have done so far. This has little to no implications, you can just push right after.
