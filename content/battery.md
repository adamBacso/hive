similar to [[galvanic cells]]

# Today’s batteries
- [[lithium batteries]]
- [[lead-acid batteries]]
- nickel-metal hydride ($\ce{ NiMH }$)
- alkaline (*lúgos*)

# Ideal battery
convers *chemical* energy into *electric* with 100% efficiency
→ constant voltage

# real battery
has losses
[[internal resistance]] due to resistance of metal parts and also the speed of electrolytic process
