>**[[discrete variable]]** or **[[continuous variable]]**
>[[changing a variable]]

> [!info] Types of Frequency 
> **[[frequency]]**
> the nimber of times a data point occurs in the sample 
>
>**[[relative frequency]]**
>the ratio between the frequency of a data point and the size of the sample (*fraction*)
>
>**[[cumulative frequency]]** 
>sums up the frequencies to a certain level
