# What is the task of the neuroendocrine system? (2p)
maintenance of homeostasis

# Compare the 2 parts of the neuroendocrine system in 1 sentence!(4p)
## Hormone system 
transported by blood, _slow communication_
## Nervous system
[[neurons]] give the signals rapidly

# What transports the hormones and what can they do with the target cell? (3p)
a. blood 
b. stimulates or inhibits cell metabolism

# Name the endocrine glands of the illustration( hypophysis, thyroid and parathyroid gland, thymus, pancreas, adrenal glands, testicles, ovaries)! (6p)

# Name 3 hormones and their tasks secreted by the anterior pituitary! (6p)
- human growth hormone - effects cell metabolism 
- thyroid stimulating hormone - stimulates thyroxine production 
- prolactin - stimulates milk production 
- follicle stimulating hormone - stimulates maturation of egg cell, ovulation, increases estrogen production, (in males) stimulates sperm cell producion
- luteinizing hormone - stimulates [[corpus luteum]] progesterone production, (in males) stimulates the androgen production

# What stores oxytocin? What is the effect of the hormone? (3p)
a. posterior pituitary
b. stimulates smooth muscle contractions of the [[uterus]] and milk excretion of mammary glands

# Name the 2 important hormones of the thyroid gland and explain their role briefly! (6p)
1. thyroxine - increases glucose usage and energy production
2. calcitonin - inhibits release of Ca from bones (triggered by high calcium levels)

# What produces the parathormone, write down its effect? (4p)
[[parathyroid]], increases Ca reabsorption in kidneys, Ca uptake in gut, and Ca release from bones (released when Ca level of blood is low)

# Name the 2 hormones of the pancreas! Why are these hormones antagonistic? (5p)
opposite effect on blood sugar 
| glucagon  | insulin |
| --------- | ------- |
| increases | lowers  |

# How can the glucagon increase the blood sugar level?(3p)
glycogen is decomposed in the liver and released into the bloodstream

# Why is insulin important for cells? Write down 2 effects of the insulin! (5p)
without insulin cells cannot absorb glucose → without glucose there’s no cell respiration
1. glycogen is created in liver and muscles 
2. transform into lipids in adipose system

# What produces glucocorticoids? Write down 2 of their effects! (3p)
[[adrenal cortex]]
1. regulate blood pressure
2. raise protein and lipid metabolism
3. increases muscle strength
4. increases glycogen storage in liver

# Name the reaction belongs to adrenaline/epinephrine! Which gland secretes it? Write down 3 effects of adrenaline! (5p)
## Fight or flight system
[[adrenal medulla]]
1. increases heart rate
2. increases blood pressure
3. increases blood sugar to help muscles and brain to deal with stress

# List the 3 hormones which high level causes ovulation (I want the long names, no abbreviation)! (3p)
high [[estrogen]], [[Follicle-stimulating hormone]], [[Luteinizing Hormone]]

# What starts menstruation at the hormonal level? (2p)
the [[corpus luteum]] moulders → progesterone level decreases

# What causes gigantism? Name 2 characteristics! (5p)
overproduction of [[growth hormone]] during childhood
1. long limbs
2. weak muscles

# What causes acromegaly, write down 2 symptoms! (5p)
overproduction of [[growth hormone]] during adulthood 
large
1. hands
2. feet
3. ears 
4. nose 
5. jaw

# What is caused by the underproduction of growth hormone during childhood? Write down 2 characteristics! (3p)
dwarfism
1. height under 140cm
2. normal or higher intelligence
3. disproportionate body

# Which hormones low level causes cretinism? Characterize the disorder in 3 points! (4p)
[[thyroxine hormone disorders|thyroxine]] 
- mental defects
- big tongue 
- lack of sexual maturation
- organ dysfunction

# What is caused by high thyroxine levels during adulthood? Write down 3 symptoms! (4p)
goitre
- big appetite but weight loss
- high blood pressure 
- tachycardia
- sweating
- diarrhea
- irritability
- hyperactivity
- bulging eyes

# List 4 symptoms of diabetes! (4p)
1. thirst
2. hunger
3. frequent urination
4. weight loss
5. blurry vision
6. fatigue
7. dry skin

# List what can contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes? (4p)
- unhealthy diet
- lack of sports
- overweight
- age
- (genetic background)

# What are the risks of diabetes without treatment? (4p)
- kidney failure
- blindness
- coma
- limbs amputation
