> When the membrane potential of a cell rapidly rises and falls

# Depolarization
- Na+ enters cell through sodium channel
- electric charge becomes positive (+30mV)

# Repolarization
- at +30mV, K+ leaves through potassium channel
- electric charge decreases below resting charge (-70mV)

# Hyperpolarization
- K+ channels close, [[sodium-potassium pump]] restores polarization to -70mV

> Action potential goes along [[axon]], jumps to other neurons through [[synapses]]
