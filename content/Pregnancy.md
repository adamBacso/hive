the *zygote* dicides and travels a week into the uterus → begins [[implantation]]

# 1st trimester (1.-12. weeks)
- conception
- [[implantation]] 
- fast development of embryo/fetus 

## Week 6

>embryo → fetus

- mother’s and fetus’ blood get in touch indirectly (through capillary walls)
- fetus connected through [[umbilical cord]]

## Week 12

- 38cm and 1.2kg at the end of trimester 
- **!!** can survive outside of the uterus (with high-quality medical care)

## Week 16-20
- movement of fetus felt

## Week 18-20
- sex organs seen on ultrasound

# 3rd trimester (29.-40. weeks)
- 500g per month
- moves less (lack of space)
- turns into a downward position (*last month*)
- fetus descends in *last 4 weeks*

# Childbirth

>the hypothalamus of the fetus initiates it

1. contraction of the [[uterus]] 
2. the [[caul]] ruptures, [[amniotic fluid]] flows away
3. [[cervix]] opens up ^59e81a
4. [[expulsion stage]]
5. placenta is pushed out (after baby)

(labor lasts 3-20 hours)
