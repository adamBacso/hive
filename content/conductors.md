electric charge is distributed “evenly”

When put into an [[electric field]], the charges on it are separated

Within the conductor, *external field* and *field created by separated charges* cancel, so inside there’s **no electric field**

Within the gap of the conductor, there’s also no electric field → [[Faraday’s cage]]
