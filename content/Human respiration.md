# Tasks
- exchange of respiratory gases ($\ce{ O_{2} }$, $\ce{ C_{2}O }$) (in [[alveoli]] )
- $\ce{ O_{2} }$ used in biological oxidation
- $\ce{ C_{2}O }$  end product of biological oxidation ([[glucose]] burning)
- gas export in the [[lung]]

# Inhalation
[[nostrils]] → [[nasal cavity]] → [[pharynx]] → [[larynx]] → [[trachea]] → [[lung]]
